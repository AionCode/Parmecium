# Parmecium

* A game called Parmecium, looks neet, works not so neet...

* A game I started a while ago, using a friends code, and I stopped working on it, it's a great starter for a 2D RPG, feel free to contribute.
* I still add sprites from time to time. If I see someone commiting code I'll be more active.

* More info on the game: https://parmecium.github.io
